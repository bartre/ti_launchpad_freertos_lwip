This is a template project for CCS7("http://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO") based on FreeRTOS 9.0.0 ("http://www.freertos.org/") and lwip IP stack library ("https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/") for EK-TM4C1294XL dev-board (http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Tiva_C_Series_TM4C1294_LaunchPad). Right now it has a working FreeRTOS port with two tasks, and simple, unfinished Ethernet driver, based on code example from TivaWare user's guide("http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/spmu298d/spmu298d.pdf").
